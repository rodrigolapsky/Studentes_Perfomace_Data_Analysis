# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project: Academic Performance

This repository showcases a project dedicated to **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and the study of **data visualization techniques**. The primary goal is to investigate how various factors influence student academic performance using a provided dataset.

## 📁 Dataset Features

The analysis is based on a dataset with the following columns:

*   `Hours Studied`
*   `Previous Scores`
*   `Extracurricular Activities`
*   `Sleep Hours`
*   `Sample Question Papers Practiced`
*   `Performance Index` (Target Variable)

## 📊 Methodology and Graph Study

The project emphasizes the practical application of data science libraries for analysis and visualization:

*   `pandas` & `numpy`: Utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and numerical operations.
*   `matplotlib.pyplot` & `seaborn`: Employed to create comprehensive statistical graphs (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, `regplots`, and `joint plots` with hexbins) to illustrate findings.

The focus of this project is learning how different graph types reveal patterns, correlations, and outliers within a multivariate dataset.

## ✨ Project Purpose

This repository serves as a learning exercise to:

*   **Practice EDA:** Understand how to extract meaningful insights from raw data.
*   **Master Visualization:** Learn to select and interpret appropriate graphical representations for different data relationships.
*   **Identify Insights:** Determine which factors correlate most strongly with the `Performance Index`.
